Here is how I want the nested databases to work:

so, lets say that I have a database, named academics. Inside that, I have a task named SAT prep.
And now, I should be able to create a nested database inside that task. Then, when I click on open, it will open it in the same database page. I can repeat this however many times I want.

Example:
---- DATABASE 1
---------- Task 1: SAT Prep
---------------NESTED DATABASE 1
--------------------NESTED DATABASE 1 TASK 1
--------------------NESTED DATABASE 1 TASK 2
---------------NESTED DATABASE 2
--------------------NESTED DATABASE 2 TASK 1
--------------------NESTED DATABASE 2 TASK 2
---------- Task 2: etc.

It should also show a tree like this inside the task aswell.

Also, at the top of the page, it should show the absolute path, kind of like github.
for example:
DATABASE 1/Task 1: SAT Prep/NESTED DATABASE 1 (if nested database 1 is open).

Please make this work.


- When adding a task, I should ACTUALLY be able to add the information of the columns.

- Please add a rich text description for all the tasks.
